# KGP-RISC

A Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) is a microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small number of simple and generalized instructions rather than complex and specialized ones. 

This microprocessor has been developed in the Verilog hardware description language, simulated on the [Xilinx ISE](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite.html) and tested on the Spartan 3 FPGA.

This is a top level overview of the microprocessor.

### Instructions

This RISC processor uses 32-bit instructions. The division of the 32-bit instructions has been inspired by the MIPS architecture.
